# 42 Lausanne - ft_printfThis project is a reimplementation of the C language's `printf` function, as part of my 42 school curriculum. The function `ft_printf(const char *input, ...)` uses variadic arguments to handle a varying number of inputs of different types.## ConversionsThe following conversions are recognized and implemented:- `%c`: Writes a character.- `%s`: Writes a string of characters.- `%p`: Prints the address of a variable in hexadecimal format.- `%d` & `%i`: Returns a decimal number in base 10.- `%u`: Returns a data value from zero to positive numbers.- `%x` & `%X`: Converts any number to its hexadecimal value.- `%%`: Writes a '%'.The function returns the count of characters written.
